```code
start
  (goto (label here))
here
  (assign a (const 3))
  (goto (label there))
here
  (assign a (const 4))
  (goto (label there))
there
```

With the way the simulator is currently written, both labels will be stored in a list in the same order they appear in the register-machine code. So when we lookup the label, the first `here` should be returned, and `a` should get the value of 3.

We can fix this by disallowing duplicate label-names in the text by changing extract-labels to lookup the label and verify it wasn't seen before.

```scheme
(define (has-label? labels label-name)
  (let ((val (assoc label-name labels)))
    (if val
        #t
        #f)))

(define (extract-labels text receive)
  (if (null? text)
      (receive '() '())
      (extract-labels 
       (cdr text)
       (lambda (insts labels)
         (let ((next-inst (car text)))
           (if (symbol? next-inst)
               (if (has-label? labels next-inst)
                   (error "Label already seen: " next-inst)
                   (receive 
                    insts
                    (cons 
                     (make-label-entry 
                      next-inst
                      insts)
                     labels)))
               (receive 
                (cons (make-instruction 
                       next-inst)
                      insts)
                labels)))))))
```
