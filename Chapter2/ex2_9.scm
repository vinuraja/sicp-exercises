; Let (a1, a2) be interval a with
; upperbound a1 and lowerbound a2,
; with width w(a) = (a1 - a2)/2.
; Similarly assume an interval b.
; So a + b = (a1 + b1, a2 + b2),
; with width = wa + wb.
; And a - b = (a1 - b2, a2 - b1)
; with width = wa - wb.
;
; Now assume the bounds are non-negative,
; then a*b = (a1*b1, a2*b2),
; with width = (a1*b1 - a2*b2)/2, which is
; not a function of wa nor wb.
;
; Similarly, a/b = (a1/b2, a2/b1),
; with width = (a1/b2 - a2/b1)/2, which again
; is not a function of wa nor wb.
